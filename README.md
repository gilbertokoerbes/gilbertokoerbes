### Hi there 👋

🎏 This is my space where I save some things I practice in my Bachelor of Computer Science and professional projects

🎏 I like networking projects, operating systems and technologies for DevOps and SRE.
If you find some projects a bit confusing, I can help. Can't wait for your contact.
